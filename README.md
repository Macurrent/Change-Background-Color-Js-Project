# Project_Change_Color_Background
Simple JavaScript Project that changes background each time a button is pressed.
This background color changing app was short and sweet to complete. Since I was given the HTML and CSS assets (really, just the styled BootStrap4 button), all I had to do was create an array of different colors and then add a â€˜click' event listener to the button. Once the button was clicked, a different background color would appear.
